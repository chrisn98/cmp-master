	 * A wrapper class represents a particular primitive type
	 * For each primitive type there exists a corresponding wrapper class in Java
	 * the Void class cannot be instantiated
	 * Autoboxing is the automatic conversion between a primitive value and a corresponding
	 * 	wrapper object
	 * The reverse condition, unboxing, occurs automatically when needed
	 * 
	 * Assignments between primitive types and object types are generally incompatible
