	/* Notes:
	 * If either or both operands to any numeric value are floating point values, 
	 * the result is the same floating point value
	 * 
	 * If integer division is performed, any fractional part of the result is thrown out 
	 * Fractions are kept in floating point division 
	 * 
	 * A unary operator has one operand, while a binary has two operands
	 * Both the + and - operators are unary or binary 
	 * Binary accomplishes addition and subtraction
	 * Unary is positive and negative 
	 * -1 invokes unary negation operator 
	 * Precedence in an expression can be forced using parentheses
	 * Parentheses can be nested, and innermost nested expressions are evaluated first
	 * In an expression tree, operators are executed from bottom up 
	 * Parentheses have a higher precedence than any other operator
	 * Parentheses must match on both the left and right side and must be properly nested
	 * 
	 * Increment Operator adds 1 to any integer or floating point value 
	 * Decrement Operator subtracts 1 from any integer of floating point value 
	 * 
	 * count++ is equivalent to count = count + 1
	 * count-- is equivalent to count = count - 1
	 * count++ is in postfix form while ++count is in prefix form 
	 * Postfix Form is more often used than Prefix Form 
	 * 
	 * The following statement assigns a value of 16 to both total and count 
	 * total = ++count
	 * 
	 * The following statement assigns a value of 15 to total and 16 to count 
	 * total = count++
