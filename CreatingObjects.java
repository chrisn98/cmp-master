	/* Notes:
	 * A variable that references an object must be declared
	 * The declarations of object variables have a similar structure to prim variables
	 * An object variable holds the address of an object
	 * A null reference specifically indicates that a variable does not refer to an object
	 * An object is also a pointer to the location in a memory address where an object is held
	 * Parentheses after a method are required to indicate that a method is being invoked
	 * An alias is two names that reference the same object
	 * Java performs automatic garbage collection when objects reference unused memory
