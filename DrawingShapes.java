	/* Notes:
	 * The graphics class is defined in the java.awt package
	 * The methods of the Graphics class allow us to specify whether want a shape filled
	 * 	or unfilled
	 * 
	 * Shapes with curves, as ovals, are often defined by a rectangle that encompasses
	 * 		their perimeters, also known as the bounding rectangle
	 * An arc can be thought of as a segment of an oval 
	 * The starting point of the arc is defined by the start angle
	 * The ending point of the arc is defined by the arc angle
	 * 
	 * Every graphics context has a current foreground color that is used when	shapes or 
	 * 	strings are drawn
	 * 
	 * Every surface that can be drawn on has a background color
