		/* Notes:
		 * A class library is a set of classes that supports the development of programs
		 * The string class is not an inherent part of the Java language
		 * The class library is made up of several clusters of related classes
		 * The classes of the java.lang package are automatically available for use when writing a Java program
		 * When you want to use a class from a class library in a program, you could use its 
		 * 	fully qualified name
		 * The import declaration specifies the packages and classes that will be used in a program 
		 * 		so that the fully qualified name is not necessary with each reference
		 * 
		 * If two classes from two different packages have the same name, import declarations will not suffice
		 * 		because the compiler won't be able to figure out which class is being referenced
		 * 		in the flow of code
