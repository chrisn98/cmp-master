 * A java application only requires the java interpreter to be present
 * A class that defines an applet extends the JApplet Class
 * The paint method is invoked whenever the graphics elements of the applet need to be 
 * 	painted to the screen 
 * In order for the applet to run in an HTML window, it must first be converted to bytecode
