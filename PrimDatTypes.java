	/* Notes
	 * There are four integer data types: int, long, byte, short
	 * There are two floating types: float and double
	 * Float and Double follow the IEEE 754 floating point standard
	 * Each type of primitive data differs by the amount of memory it can store 
	 * If a numeric type is signed, both + and - values can be stored in the primitive data type
	 * A character set is a list of characters in a particular order
	 * Two types of character sets exist 
	 * 	ASCII, 8-bits starts with 128 characters, extends to 256 chars
	 * 	Unicode,16-bits contains 65535 characters
	 * Booleans are conditional statements, true/false
	 * A character literal is encapsulated in single quotation marks Ex: 'A'
	 * Char, a primitive data type is 16 bits. 
	 * 		Although escape sequences may be used with char, it can be used with other 
	 * 		primitive data types as well 
	 * A floating point literal is also considered a double 
	 * Hexadecimal literal begins with 0x 
	 * Binary literal begins with 0b
