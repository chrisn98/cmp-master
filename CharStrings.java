		 * \\ = backslash 
		 * String concatenation is performed using the + operand
		 * A number is not part of a character string
		 * print and println serve two different purposes
		 * print does not move to next line, println moves to next line
		 * a string literal is defined by double quotation characters
		 * A character string/literal cannot span two lines therefore concatenation is required
