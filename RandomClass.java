	/* Notes:
	 * The random class represents a pseudorandom number generator
	 * the nextInt method can be called with no parameters, or we can give it a single 
	 * 	integer value
	 * the version that takes no parameters generates a random number across the entire
	 * 	range of int values
	 * the version that has a parameter generates a number from the beginning of the range to the 
	 * 	end of the parameter
	 * the nextFloat method returns a float value that is greater than or equal to 0.0 and 
	 * 	less than 1.0
	 *
